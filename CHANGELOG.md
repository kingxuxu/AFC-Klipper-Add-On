## [Unreleased]

### Added

 - Added `loaded_to_hub` parameter to get_status so users can see if filament is loaded to  their hub
 - Added `SET_BOWDEN_LENGTH LENGTH={}` to change `afc_bowden_length`
      - Length can be changed in 3 ways:
          - An exact value can be set. `SET_BOWDEN_LENGTH LENGTH=955` will set the Bowden length to 955mm
          - Current value can be incremented positive or negative.
             - `SET_BOWDEN_LENGTH LENGTH=+100` if the original length was `955` it will be changed to `1055`
             - `SET_BOWDEN_LENGTH LENGTH=-100` if the original length was `955` it will be changed to `855`
       - `SET_BOWDEN_LENGTH` is called without a `LENGTH` specified then the value will be reset back to the configured length
       - Changed distance will have to be manually updated in `AFC.cfg`

### Changed

 - Revamped `install-afc.sh` script to be interactive and provide more configuration options for the user.
 - Updated `ruff` GHA to only scan for changed files.
 - Updates to AFC.cfg file. Be sure to backup current file and replace with new version, then update values from backed up file.
 - Manually changes needed to AFC_hardware.cfg
    - `[filament_switch_sensor tool]` update to `[filament_switch_sensor tool_start]`
    - If using sensor after gears `[filament_switch_sensor extruder]` updaste to `[filament_switch_sensor tool_end]`
